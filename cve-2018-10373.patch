Subject: [PATCH binutils] Add a check for a NULL table pointer before attempting to
 compute a DWARF filename.

This patch fix CVE-2018-10373 

concat_filename in dwarf2.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a
crafted binary file, as demonstrated by nm-new.


	PR 23065
	* dwarf2.c (concat_filename): Check for a NULL table pointer.
